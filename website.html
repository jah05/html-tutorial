<pre>Knicks lose out on draft lottery once again, dropping from the projected 6th pick
to the 8<sup>th</sup> pick in their ill-fated season. Pray for them.

<pre>Good news for Timberwolves fans, despite missing the playoffs with <del><i>Andrew Wiggins</i></del> <i>D'Angelo Russell</i>
it gave you a chance at the NBA Lottery. Guess what, you hold the <em style="font-family:impact;color:green">FIRST PICK</em><sub>subject to change</sub>

<p>Here are some takes</p>
<blockquote cite="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2905589-nba-lottery-results-2020-full-selection-order-analysis-and-more">
The general belief all year had LaMelo Ball, Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman as top-three overall favorites, with Obi Toppin,
Deni Avdija, Onyeka Okongwu and Isaac Okoro mixed into a tier that either slightly overlaps or follows. But based from some
scouts' takes I've heard over the past few weeks, mock drafts could start looking silly right from the top.       -Wasserman
